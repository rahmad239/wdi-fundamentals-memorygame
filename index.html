      <h2> Instructions </h2>
      <p> Concentration, also known as Match Match, Memory, Pelmanism, Shinkei-suijaku, Pexeso or simply Pairs, is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards. </p>

    <h2> Why Play? </h2>
      <p> This game has several positive reasons to play. First, its FUN! Also, memory exercises have been proven to help improve memory retention. Lastly, Its a great game for the whole family. I took great pride in creating this. As one of my first projects I took aspects of all of my prior career experience into account while doing it.
